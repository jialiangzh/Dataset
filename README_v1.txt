============================= HOW TO USE =============================

i )  1a, 1b, 1c are excel files, with user-friendly feature that can
	 direct user to the online resources which contain detailed information.
	 The fields have such functionality are highlighted in blue.
	
ii)  2a, 2b, 2c are web-page files, with the same functionality above, yet
	 with much faster online resources accessing speed since it is web-based 
	 rather than excel format.
	
iii) 3a, 3b, 3c are csv format files, can be viewed using excel (where it has
	 nicer and cleaner view for quick reference and searching). These files
	 can also be used for future data processing, exploratory analysis and
	 being injected to other software.
	 
iv)  4a, 4b, 4c are tsv format files, used as backups, can be viewed using
	 excel as well.

========================== TOOLS & SOURCES ===========================

These matching results were computed against:
	Mus musculus genes (GRCm38.p2)

from:
	Ensembl Genes 77
	
online database (http://uswest.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/Info/Index)

using open-source tool:
	BioMart

Currently, the rendering results are based on:

	GSM1299598_Mouse.Control.RARa.bed
	
data and the first 3000 rows within the dataset.

( including all of Chromosome 1 in 1a & 1b & 1c, and part of
  Chromosome 10 in 1c )


Because the BioMart has limitations on injected data size, a sub-dataset
of 1000 items is being used for each iteration.

======================== MATCHING RESULTS =============================

This is the matching results (in total of 41388 Genes) :

subset_1_1000 	 : 236/41388 Genes
subset_1001_2000 : 207/41388 Genes
subset_2001_3000 : 168/41388 Genes


For each columns in the table generated, the column names / data field names are:

Chromosome Name | Gene Start (bp) | Gene End (bp) | Associated Gene Name | Description	Strand | 

Band | Associated Gene Source | Source (gene) | Status (gene) | Version (gene)
